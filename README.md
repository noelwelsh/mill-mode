# mill-mode
Emacs mode to use the Mill Scala build tool.

The two main functions are:

- `mill-compile-current-module` which will compile the current module, prompting for a module is one has not been selected yet

- `mill-test-current-module` which will test the current module, prompting for a module is one has not been selected yet


Other functions will be added over time. Open an issue (or better, a PR) if you find something missing.
